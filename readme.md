# My First Minecraft Plugin

This is my very first Minecraft plugin, created as a learning project.

The main goal of this project is to improve my skills in **Java programming** by building something fun and practical.

I'm using this plugin as a way to:
- Learn the basics of Java and object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Get more comfortable with Java syntax and structure
- Explore the Bukkit/Spigot API (or Paper, depending on the platform)
- Understand how Minecraft plugins work behind the scenes

This project is a work in progress, and I'll be adding features and improvements as I learn more!

---

### ðŸ”§ Built with
- Java

### ðŸ§  Learning goals

- Event handling in Minecraft
- Plugin lifecycle (`onEnable`, `onDisable`)
- Registering commands and listeners
- Structuring a basic plugin project

Feel free to follow along as I improve and add new features!
